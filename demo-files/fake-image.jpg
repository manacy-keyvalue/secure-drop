MZ      ÿÿ  ¸       @  €  !     €        This file appears to be a JPEG image but contains executable code!

This is a Windows PE executable file disguised as a JPEG image.
The magic bytes "MZ" at the beginning reveal its true nature.

SecureDrop's magic byte validation will detect this mismatch between:
- File Extension: .jpg
- MIME Type: image/jpeg (claimed)
- Actual Content: Windows PE Executable

Malicious payload simulation:
- Could contain trojans, viruses, or backdoors
- Bypasses simple extension filtering
- Requires deep content inspection to detect

This demonstrates why magic byte validation is critical for security.
